# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe Hands and OpenCV. The system detects hand landmarks from webcam video input and classifies simple finger gestures such as Thumbs Up, Index Finger Up, Middle Finger Up, Ring Finger Up, and Pinky Finger Up.
